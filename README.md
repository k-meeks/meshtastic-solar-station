# Iowa Solar-Powered Meshtastic Base Station

A professional-grade autonomous Meshtastic repeater designed for Iowa's extreme weather conditions. This project combines a high-gain ground plane antenna, solar power system, and precision 3D printed components to create a reliable mesh network node with 15+ mile range. This project was designed by the author with the assistance of Claude.AI The text and drawings are all generated by Claude.AI with prompting from the author, and light editing after the fact. 

## As of July 4, 2025 this project has not been completed. This remains a theoretical design until I update this text.

## 🔧 Quick Start

1. **Print the radial and vertical hub** from `3d-models`
2. **Cut fiberglass rods** to 3.2" lengths (5 pieces)
3. **Prepare copper wires** - 4 parallel wires per rod
4. **Assemble electronics** in PVC box with solar panels
5. **Mount at elevation** - 25 feet recommended
6. **Configure Meshtastic** firmware for your region

## 🌟 Why This Design Works

### Elevation Advantage
At 25 feet, this station has significant line-of-sight advantage over ground-level nodes. The height alone provides 10-15dB effective gain compared to typical installations.

### Iowa Climate Optimization
- **Fiberglass construction** handles temperature extremes (-40°F to 200°F range)
- **35° solar panel tilt** optimized for Iowa latitude (~41°N)
- **Sealed enclosure** protects electronics from moisture and dust
- **Wind-resistant design** using guy wires if needed

### Professional Engineering
- **Mathematically precise 45° radial angles** for optimal impedance matching
- **Cage monopole design** with 4 wires per element for enhanced performance
- **Proper ground plane** dimensions for 915MHz resonance
- **Low noise figure** design prioritizing receive sensitivity

## 🔬 Technical Innovation

This project demonstrates several advanced concepts:
- **Cage monopole antenna** design for enhanced bandwidth
- **Solar autonomy** calculations for northern latitude
- **Parametric 3D design** for precision mechanical components
- **Integrated system approach** combining antenna, radio, and power
