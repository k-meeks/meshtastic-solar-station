# Ground Plane Antenna Design Guide

## Theory and Design Principles

### Why Ground Plane Antennas Work

A ground plane antenna is a monopole antenna with artificial ground radials. It's essentially half of a dipole antenna, where the missing half is "reflected" by the ground plane radials.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Omnidirectional coverage** in the horizontal plane
- **Low takeoff angle** - ideal for long-distance communication
- **50Ω impedance match** when properly designed
- **Simple construction** with readily available materials

### Design Calculations for 915MHz

**Wavelength Calculation:**
```
λ = c / f = 300,000,000 m/s / 915,000,000 Hz = 0.328 meters = 12.9 inches
```

**Quarter-Wave Elements:**
```
λ/4 = 12.9" / 4 = 3.225 inches ≈ 3.2 inches (81mm)
```

**Critical Dimensions:**
- **Vertical radiator length:** 3.2 inches
- **Ground radial length:** 3.2 inches each
- **Number of radials:** 4 minimum (more = better)
- **Radial angle:** 45° below horizontal

## Impedance Matching Theory

### Why 45° Matters

The ground radial angle directly affects the antenna's feed impedance:

| Radial Angle | Feed Impedance | SWR (50Ω system) |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0° (horizontal) | ~25Ω | 2:1 |
| 30° | ~35Ω | 1.4:1 |
| **45°** | **~50Ω** | **1:1** |
| 60° | ~65Ω | 1.3:1 |
| 90° (vertical) | ~75Ω+ | 1.5:1+ |

**The 45° angle is optimal** because it transforms the antenna's natural impedance to match standard 50Ω coaxial cable and radio systems.

## Cage Monopole Enhancement

### Multi-Wire Design Benefits

Using **4 parallel wires per element** instead of single wire creates a "cage monopole" with several advantages:

**Electrical Benefits:**
- **Lower resistance** - parallel conductors reduce ohmic losses
- **Increased bandwidth** - wider effective conductor
- **Better current distribution** - more uniform field pattern
- **Higher efficiency** - less power lost as heat

**Mechanical Benefits:**
- **Redundancy** - if one wire breaks, others maintain function
- **Better attachment** to fiberglass support rods
- **Improved weatherproofing** - multiple connection points

### Current Distribution

In a properly designed ground plane antenna:
- **Maximum current** flows at the feed point (base of vertical element)
- **Zero current** (voltage maximum) at the tip of the vertical element
- **Radial currents** flow outward from center, returning via ground plane

## Radiation Pattern Analysis

### Horizontal Pattern (Azimuth)

The antenna produces an **omnidirectional pattern** in the horizontal plane:
- **360° coverage** with minimal variation
- **Typical gain:** 2-3 dBi over isotropic radiator
- **Pattern symmetry** improves with more radials

### Vertical Pattern (Elevation)

The ground plane creates a **low takeoff angle**:
- **Maximum radiation** at 10-20° above horizon
- **Minimal high-angle radiation** - reduces wasted power
- **Ideal for long-distance communication** at VHF/UHF frequencies

## Material Selection for Iowa Climate

### Fiberglass Rod Advantages

**Temperature Performance:**
- **Operating range:** -40°F to 200°F
- **Thermal expansion:** Minimal compared to metals
- **UV stability:** Excellent with proper resin systems

**Electrical Properties:**
- **Dielectric constant:** ~4-6 (relatively transparent at 915MHz)
- **Loss tangent:** Very low
- **No RF interaction** at these frequencies

**Mechanical Properties:**
- **Tensile strength:** Higher than steel by weight
- **Flexibility:** Won't snap in ice storms
- **Corrosion resistance:** Unaffected by weather

### Copper Wire Selection

**12 AWG Solid Copper Benefits:**
- **Low resistance:** 1.59 ohms per 1000 feet
- **Skin depth at 915MHz:** ~2.2 μm (well within conductor)
- **Mechanical strength:** Solid wire maintains shape
- **Solderability:** Easy connections

## Construction Tolerances

### Critical Dimensions

**Element Length Tolerance:** ±1mm (±0.04")
- **Too long:** Resonance shifts lower in frequency
- **Too short:** Resonance shifts higher in frequency
- **Target:** 81mm ±1mm for 915MHz operation

**Radial Angle Tolerance:** ±5°
- **42-48° range** maintains acceptable SWR
- **Precision 3D printed hub** ensures repeatability

### Feed Point Construction

**SMA Connector Requirements:**
- **Impedance:** 50Ω
- **Frequency rating:** DC to 18GHz (915MHz well within range)
- **Weatherproofing:** Use bulkhead style with gaskets

**Connection Method:**
1. **Vertical element wires:** All 4 connect to center pin
2. **Radial wires:** All 16 connect to outer conductor/ground
3. **Solder all connections:** Use 60/40 rosin core solder
4. **Seal thoroughly:** Marine-grade silicone or heat shrink

## Performance Optimization

### Ground Plane Size Effects

The 4×4" PVC box top provides adequate ground plane:
- **Electrical size:** ~0.3λ × 0.3λ at 915MHz
- **Sufficient for proper operation**
- **Larger = better,** but diminishing returns beyond 0.5λ

### Environmental Considerations

**Nearby Objects:**
- **Keep metal objects** >λ/4 (3+ inches) away
- **Mounting pole** should be non-conductive or grounded
- **Guy wires** (if used) should be broken up with insulators

**Height Effects:**
- **Each doubling of height** ≈ +6dB effective gain
- **25-foot elevation** provides significant advantage
- **Ground reflection** constructively adds to direct signal

## Measurement and Tuning

### SWR Measurement

**Target Values:**
- **SWR < 1.5:1** across 902-928MHz band
- **Minimum SWR** should occur at ~915MHz
- **Bandwidth** typically ±10MHz for SWR < 2:1

**Tuning Adjustments:**
- **Frequency too low:** Trim vertical element slightly
- **Frequency too high:** Extend vertical element slightly
- **High SWR across band:** Check radial angles and connections

### Field Strength Testing

**Real-World Performance:**
- **Compare RSSI/SNR** with other Meshtastic nodes
- **Test at various distances** and times of day
- **Document performance** vs. elevation and weather

## Advanced Considerations

**Cost Comparison:**
- **This design:** ~$30 total
- **Commercial equivalent:** $75-150
- **Performance:** Equal or better due to custom optimization
